Technology is not always about software. Hardware plays a major part in it because it is what runs the world at the end of the day.

At our homes, the normal internet user will have one router provided by their ISEP (internet service provider) and that will suffice it's needs. But I could not settle for that.

My ISP provided me with the [Technicolor TG789VAC V2](https://openwrt.org/inbox/toh/technicolor/tg789vac_v2), a dual core and 256MB sample of a router. It was not enogh for me. When I say _sample of a router_ I do not mean to bash on Technicolor's creation, just the choice of router for my ISP.

I currently have an uplink of 500Mbps of download and 100Mbps of upload and this router has 5 Gigabit ports that should, in theory, be sufficient for normal usage. The problem started when managing devices, configurations or fetching simple information. Here follows a list of problems I had with this router:

- The login took 5 minutes at times, and it even timed-out at some point
- The router could not recognize the same device two times, so two entries would appear for each device on the 'known devices list'
- The router was not able to keep 3 gigabit ports running at full speed and the 5GHz Wi-Fi connection running at decent speeds, the 5 GHz would drop to about 100Mbps
- It clearly overheated since the plastic was hot to the touch, with no way to fetch temperature information

And the list could continue with my experience from almost 3 years with this ISP router. But, at some point, i decided I wanted to invest in something better, that could solve all my problems and have cool features at the same time.

So enters Asus and their networking equipment. There are a lot of major players on the networking industry, some are more data-center focused, other also provide home-networking solutions (like Ubiquiti, that has a perfect balance of offers). I chose Asus because of their reputation, my experience with their devices (mostly laptops) in the past, and the fact that they provide some real powerful routers.
